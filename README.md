# GameOfLife
The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

# The rules:
When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
- I can start and stop the board.
- I can clear the board.
- When I press start, the game will play out.
- Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
