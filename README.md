# GameOfLife
The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

# The rules:
When you first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
- You can start and stop the board.
- You can clear the board.
- When you press start, the game will play out.
- Each time the board changes, and you can see how many generations have gone by.
